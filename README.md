# Sonar-Using-Arduino
We are using an ultrasound sensor which emits a signal through the trigger pin and takes in the reflected wave from the echo pin. Hence by using the speed of sound, calculate the distance of an object from the sensor. Servo motor rotates the sensor through 180 degrees to cover the area.
